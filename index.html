               <P>Hip hop, or rap, came about in 1970s New York City.  Propelled by  African Americans, Latino Americans, and Caribbean Americans; the genre is defined by rythmic beats, flowy cadences, and rhyming vocals.  Rap has evolved many times throughout history, starting with a heavy emphasis on rhythm, shifting to a heavier emphasis on rhyming, and steadily becoming more focused on melodic beats and clever lyrcism to this day.  Andre 3000, Ye(formerly known as Kanye West), Jay-Z, and Eminem are just a few names you'll hear in conversations about the best, all time hip hop artists.  Compared to other genres, hip hop's subgenres are not as easily defined, making fresh and experimental sounds abundant across the genre.</P>

               <p>EDM is an extremely broad genre consisting of exactly what it sounds like; electronic music made for dancing.  <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music">House</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno">techno</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trance_music">trance</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_garage">UK garage(UKG)</a></b> are just a few of the many subgenres that make up EDM.  EDM erupted because of the introduction of new electronic instruments in the 1980s.  The sound has been a staple in club, festival, and rave culture since it's emergence.  That along with drugs being commonly referenced in songs has caused many to associate the music with drug use and abuse.  It first became mainstream in Europe, later spreading to The United States(reluctantly), Australia and across the globe.  My favorite thing about EDM and rave culture is the acronym PLUR; Peace Love Unity Respect.  It's been adopted as a sort of set of values to uphold in many communities and I think it's pretty simple to see why it's my favorite thing about EDM(besides the music, of course).</p>

               <p>Rock&#47;Rock and roll is a genre that started in the late 1940s&#47;early 1950s.  It's foundations are rooted in the jazz, rhythm and blues, folk, and country genres of the time just before it's conception.  Since then it has encompassed a very diverse range of sounds, mainly centering on the electric guitar.  Most popular rock music is made by bands, generally made up of a lead guitarist, rhythm guitarist, bassist, drummer, and a lead vocalist if needed.  A few of the many subgenres of rock music include; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_rock"><b>classic rock</b></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_rock"><b>psychedelic rock</b></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock"><b>punk rock</b></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"><b>alternative rock</b></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_rock"><b>pop rock</b></a>.  The genre is perpetually experimenting and fuzing to make new and fresh sounds in a familiar style, making rock one of the oldest and most broad genres of the modern day music scene.  My personal favorites are alternative&#47;indie, pop rock, grunge, and psychedelic rock.</p>

               <p>Pop music, which is short for popular music, arose around the same time as rock and roll, in the 1950s.  Rock and pop music were actually basically synonymous until the tailend of the 1960s, when pop became linked to music that came and went more quickly, and was more commercial and family friendly.  Pop nowadays is known by its upbeat and light hearted style, many songs being about love or fun topics.  Pop is probably the most broad genre today, since anything that is popular could technically be pop, many rock subgenres are essentially pop with an emphasis on the roots that make both pop and rock.  Even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley"><b>Elvis Presley</b></a>, dubbed the "King of Rock and Roll", would be classified as a pop artist if he were arising today.  Another common theme in pop music is appealing to the youth, you will notice the biggest fans of pop are usually younger people, many that are teenagers or even younger.  Pop has a knack for not being very offensive, vulgar, or experimental.  It is made to appeal to the masses regardless of age, sex, race, religion or any other class, making it no surprise as to why quite literal "popular" music is the majority of music you will hear in mainstream radio, television and public settings.</p>
